# Overview
The first project in the Udacity/ALX Data Analyst Nanodegree program. I worked on the No-show Appointments dataset.  

The link to the data was provided by Udacity. The data provides characteristics of people that show up and those that do not show up for their medical appointments, and this project seeks to identify the characteristics that describe wheather or not a patient will show up for their medical appointment. 

## Project 

 The major questions this project seeks to explore are as follows: 
 * Does sending an SMS reminder of an appointment affect the number of no-shows?
 * Do more handicapped patients show up for their appointments as compared to patients who are not handicapped?
 * Are females or males more likely to miss their appointment?

The project is an introduction to data analysis and touches on the following:
* Data wrangling 
* Generation of visualization
* Communication of insights

__Note:__ No-show appointments have the value 'Yes' and fulfilled appointments have the value 'No' in the no-show column of the dataset.
